# TC55 Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

## Reporting Guidelines

- If a security issue is present in an implementation, report it directly to the relevant project.
- If a security issue is present in a TC55 Draft, Technical Report, Specification, or Standard, report it using [GitHub
  Security Advisories](https://github.com/tc39/.github/security/advisories).
