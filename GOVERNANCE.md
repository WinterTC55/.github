WinterTC (TC55) is a technical committee of the standards body Ecma International. Ecma is a membership-driven SDO that
prides itself on consensus-driven collaboration of a diverse background of participants, from major tech companies to
small business and everything in between, as well as universities and not-for-profit entitles.

Due to the consensus-driven nature of TC55's work, voting is an unlikely occurrence. In the rare occasion where voting
is found to be necessary, each membership organisation gets one vote, irrespective of how many delegates that
organisation has participating. Invited Experts are not entitled to vote.

The chair of TC55 is [Luca Casonato][luca] of Deno Land Inc. The vice-chair is [Andreu Botella][andreu] of Igalia, S. L.

This group was chartered as a community group under W3C before its transition to Ecma International. You can read [the
founding charter][charter] in [the archive][archive].

Ecma Technical Committees do not have charters, they have programmes of work. You can see TC55's [Programme of
Work][programme] on the Ecma website. It's copied below, but in case of conflict the canonical version is the one on
https://ecma-international.org/.

## Programme of work:

1. Standardize and maintain a minimum common API consisting of a curated collection of web standard interfaces which
   form a common base to be supported by all “minimum common API compliant” environments, targeted at ECMAScript server
   runtimes.
2. Collect and document the requirements of non-web browser minimum common API compliant environments as input/feedback
   to the development of other standards developed either elsewhere within Ecma Technical Committees or other relevant
   standards bodies, working groups, and community groups – in particular the W3C and WHATWG. These requirements may be
   published as Ecma Technical Reports.
3. Should it become necessary, the committee will develop and standardize new APIs for capabilities relevant to server
   and server-like runtimes which have requirements beyond the scope of web platform standards and core language
   capabilities (defined in TC39). TC55 will prioritize working with existing web standards and existing standards
   Working Groups and Technical Committees over publishing novel standards.
4. Standardize and maintain conformance levels that group web APIs and novel standards. The first conformance level is
   the minimum common API. Further conformance levels exceed the minimum common API and may be relevant to servers only.
5. Produce and maintain a clear and verifiable definition of compliance to every conformance level and novel
   publication.
